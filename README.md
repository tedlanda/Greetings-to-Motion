**Introduction**

Created a VR application on Android and iOS compatible with Google Cardboard where a user can select actions from a menu list in order to explore space in VR. A player has 5 options to chose from. They can make particles fly, toggle shapes, create a sunrise and sunset, change colors of the shape, and reset the position of the shape.

__Development Process__

Was given the opportunity to play around with UdacityFunEffects in the Inspector and with that utilized a series of effects to create a menu list of options a user can choose from and placed on the x-axis (floor). Then, added a primitive to the scene (sphere) and gave it the ability to shape shift to a cube (red to green). In Unity, a selected text was initiated to describe the directions on how to play the game and GVR SDK was downloaded and inserted for proper stereoscopic rendering. 

__User Testing__
Many builds have been loaded from Unity to my Android Nexus 5X device. Each time something went wrong, it was up to me to correct it. Sometimes the shape wouldn't toggle when I wanted it to and sometimes the colors of the menu items were the same as the template. I wanted the game to be as original as possible so after a few builds I decided to rename the menu items in a unique format. I changed the highlight colors and after a while, I was able to design a flawless application.
