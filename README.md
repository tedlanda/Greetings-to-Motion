**Introduction**

Created a VR application on Android and iOS compatible with Google Cardboard where a user can select actions from a menu list in order to explore space in VR. A player has 5 options to chose from. They can make particles fly, toggle shapes, create a sunrise and sunset, change colors of the shape, and reset the position of the shape.

__Development Process__

Was given the opportunity to play around with UdacityFunEffects in the Inspector and with that utilized a series of effects to create a menu list of options a user can choose from and placed on the x-axis (floor). Then, added a primitive to the scene (sphere) and gave it the ability to shape shift to a cube (red to green). In Unity, a selected text was initiated to describe the directions on how to play the game and GVR SDK was downloaded and inserted for proper stereoscopic rendering.
