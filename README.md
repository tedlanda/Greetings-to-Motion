# Greetings-to-Motion
Created a VR application on Android and iOS compatible with Google Cardboard where a user can select actions from a menu list in order to explore space in VR.

A player has 5 options to chose from. They can make particles fly, toggle shapes, change colors of the shape, reset the position of the shape, and change cubes to spheres and vice versa.
